📊 Hotel Revenue Forecasting Using Machine Learning
Project Title:
📈 ADR Prediction for Hotel Revenue Optimization – Phase 2 of Grocery Automation Project

⭐ Summary
This project showcases how I used machine learning to predict Average Daily Rate (ADR) for hotel bookings using a real-world dataset. I applied advanced regression modeling to help hotels forecast potential revenue — a task similar in complexity to managing resources, labor, and cost in a high-pressure restaurant setting.

As a former Chief Steward overseeing dish crews in fine dining, I understand the importance of precision, efficiency, and quick decision-making — all critical traits in both restaurant ops and data analytics.

🧠 Problem
In hospitality, overbooking, seasonality, and guest segmentation can lead to unpredictable fluctuations in revenue. For hotels to remain competitive, accurate ADR forecasting is essential for setting prices, allocating rooms, and improving profitability.

Hotels often struggle to:

Forecast demand across different hotel types and dates.

Adjust pricing dynamically based on market segment.

Make use of existing data for better decision-making.

💡 Solution
To solve this, I built a machine learning model using scikit-learn that predicts ADR with over 73% R² accuracy, using a blend of numerical and categorical booking features.

🔧 Tools & Libraries Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

Google Colab for development

Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV

Looker Studio for data visualization (export-ready CSV)

GitHub for code and project tracking

🎯 STAR Method Breakdown
S – Situation
As part of my career pivot into data analytics, I wanted to demonstrate how my operational skills from restaurant management — where forecasting demand and optimizing workflows were daily responsibilities — could translate into real data solutions.

T – Task
Predict the Average Daily Rate (ADR) for hotel reservations using machine learning. The goal was to develop a model that could help hotels make data-driven pricing decisions to maximize revenue.

A – Action
Cleaned and preprocessed data from the Hotel Booking Demand dataset.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find key features influencing ADR.

Built and evaluated multiple regression models:

Linear Regression (baseline)

Decision Tree Regressor (tuned)

Randomized Search with Gradient Boosting

Tuned hyperparameters to improve model performance.

Exported final predictions with contextual features (e.g., hotel type, market segment, reservation date).

Designed the output for a potential dashboard in Looker Studio.

R – Result
Achieved MSE: 614.35 and R²: 0.732 using RandomizedSearchCV — a major improvement over baseline models.

Prepared a dashboard-ready CSV to visualize ADR predictions over time by hotel type or segment.

Demonstrated that my leadership skills (efficiency, systems thinking, and communication) can be translated into real-world, value-driven analytics.

📌 Key Results
Model	MSE	R² Score
Linear Regression	871.80	0.620
Decision Tree	627.08	0.727
Random Search	614.35	0.733 ✅

📈 Future Plans
Integrate this CSV into Looker Studio to showcase dynamic hotel revenue dashboards.

Extend the project into time series forecasting (e.g., Prophet or LSTM).

Add this project to my LinkedIn portfolio to continue building in public.

💼 Why This Project Matters
In the kitchen, timing and systems matter — it’s about knowing when to prep, how much labor to allocate, and how to avoid waste. Data analytics requires the same mindset: interpret signals, find patterns, and act with precision. This project proves that I can do both — in a restaurant or with code.
